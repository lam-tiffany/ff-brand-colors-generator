# FFAI Brand Colors Generator v.1.0

A color modification tool for generating non-primary branded colors required in the FFAI app.\
App URL: https://ffbrandcolors.netlify.app/

## Purpose

- Serves as a helper tool for devs while changing / testing brand primary colors.
- Instead of installing another package ([TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) - color modification package) in our official app to generate other non-primary branded color codes, devs can feel free to use **FF Brand Colors Generator** to copy the required color codes to use.

## Credits

Made with [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) and [React-Color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/).\
Inspired by [LESS Colour Function Calculator](https://nicothin.pro/lessColourFunctionCalculator/) and my teammates' struggles.
